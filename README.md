# Escape the Camera Cafe VR 🎮

## Introduction

**Escape the Camera Cafe VR** is a virtual reality escape room game developed by Marco Mistretta and Girolamo Macaluso as part of their studies at Università degli Studi di Firenze. The game is designed to provide an immersive and challenging experience where players must solve puzzles to escape a camera cafe-themed environment.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to create a Camera Cafe-themed VR escape room using a game engine and office assets. The game is built with Unity 2021.3.4f1 LTS and utilizes the Synty Assets repository for the environment and objects.

## Gameplay and Features

### Player Movement 🚶‍♂️

The game supports various types of artificial VR locomotion, including:
- **Teleportation**
- **Scripted Movement**
- **Avatar Movement**
- **Snap Turn Provider:** Rotates the rig by fixed angles.
- **Continuous Turn Provider:** Smoothly rotates the rig over time.

### Game Design 🧩

The game features a meticulously designed office scene and tutorial scene to help players get accustomed to the mechanics and controls. The game design includes dynamic collision handling, socket interactors, and animated objects for a realistic and interactive experience.

### Physics Management ⚙️

Physics management is a crucial part of the game, ensuring smooth interactions and realistic object movements. The game uses both discrete and continuous dynamic collision detection methods.

### Object Movement and Event Management 🔄

Objects in the game can be moved and interacted with using various mechanisms, including spherical linear interpolation and scripted animations. The game also features a robust event management system to trigger events based on player actions.

### Sound Effects and Visual Effects 🔊✨
